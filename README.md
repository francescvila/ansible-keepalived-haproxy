## About The Project

This is an ansible project for locally configuring and testing two master-backup proxys balancing over two web servers.
This project has been tested on Vagrant virtual machines using Debian GNU/Linux 10.x Buster/Stable Minimal Install (64 bit) as VM box image.
It is perfectly valid for configuring two remote servers as master-backup servers, by changing the hosts IP addresses and creating an ansible user and granting access. It will also be necessary having a floating IP address (elastic or global).


### Built With

Vagrant and VirtualBox are used to easily create local virtual machines.
Ansible playbooks are used to manage configuration on the virtual machines.
Jinja2 templating engine is used to customize remote configuration files.

## Getting Started

Jinja is a web template engine for the Python programming language. It is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.

Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments. It tries to simplify the software configuration management of virtualization in order to increase development productivity. Vagrant needs the VirtualBox to be installed on the same machine than Vagrant.

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. Ansible is agentless, temporarily connecting remotely via SSH to do its tasks.


### Prerequisites

We'll install VirtualBox, Vagrant and Ansible on Ubuntu.
Ubuntu builds are available in a PPA.
To configure the PPA on your machine and install Ansible run these commands:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
```

### Installation

In order to run ansible playbooks, ansible must me installed locally.
See the Official Ansible Latest Installation Guide and Jinja2 Templating User Guide links in the links section.
See also how to install Ansible on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

With VirtualBox and Vagrant some virtual machines will be created. Ansible playbooks will configure on them all is needed to test.
Find how to install VirtualBox and Vagrant in the links section.

**VAGRANT**

Vagrant can be used to to boot a Linux virtual machine inside your laptop and use it as a server to test Ansible playbooks.

Vagrant needs the VirtualBox virtualizer to be installed on your machine.

Install the VirtualBox package with (Debian):
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virtualbox
```

Optionally install the extension pack with (Debian):
```sh
sudo apt install virtualbox-ext-pack
```

Install the VirtualBox package with (Debian):
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vagrant
```

Check Vagrant installation:
```sh
vagrant --version
```


VirtualBox has made a change (restriction) to the default allowed network ranges. The allowed ranges go from 192.168.56.0/21 to 192.168.63.0/21. This behaviour can be overridden by creating a /etc/vbox/networks.conf file on the host filesystem with the following contents to unlock all allowed ranges:
```sh
* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0
```

We'll go with the 192.168.60.0/24 range.

Create a new host network adapter with IPv4 address/mask 192.168.60.0/24. The DHCP server can be disabled.
```sh
VBoxManage hostonlyif create
VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig <name> --ip 192.168.60.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0
vboxmanage dhcpserver modify --ifname <name> --disable
```

You can list host-only network interfaces:
```sh
VBoxManage list hostonlyifs
```

Create/start up vagrant machines by using:
```sh
vagrant up ([hostname1] [hostname2])
```

Stop vagrant machines by using:
```sh
vagrant halt ([hostname1] [hostname2])
```

Stop and destroy vagrant machines by using:
```sh
vagrant destroy ([hostname1] [hostname2])
```

You can SSH to a vagrant machine by using:

```sh
vagrant ssh [hostname]
```

All provisioned vagrant hosts are defined in the file named 'Vagrantfile'.

You can check the status of all VMs created with Vagrant:
```sh
vagrant global-status
```

**ANSIBLE**

The ansible config file (ansible.cfg) has been set to log in the vagrant instancies with the user name 'vagrant', using de same SSH private key file (~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key). So, I won't be necessary to create a specific user to SSH from the Ansible control node (your machine).

Ansible hosts are remote servers that are monitored and controlled by the Ansible control node.

Let's install Ansible.
* Make sure your systemâ€™s package index is up to date. Refresh the package index with the command:
```sh
sudo apt update
```
* Install Ansible on Ubuntu with the command:
```sh
sudo apt install ansible
```
Remote hosts (the vagrant instances) are defined in the hosts file (inventories/vagrant/hosts).
Every folder under the inventories folder define an environment.
In our case, we only have one environment: vagrant.
Each enviroment has its group_vars folder with the definition of variables for every role.
Each role represents a group of servers by role: all, proxy, web.
The role 'all' applies to all of the roles.

The 'inventories/vagrant' directory has been defined in the ansible.cfg file as the inventory by default.

You can check the accessible hosts by using:
```sh
ansible-inventory --list -y
```
The final step is making sure the Ansible control node connects to the remote hosts and run commands.

* To test the connection with the hosts, use the following command in the terminal on your control node:
```sh
ansible all -m ping
```

* You can also check remote hostname by using:
```sh
ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_hostname'
```

## Usage

When using Vagrant and VirtualBox to create virtual machines and Ansible as the provisioner, you can create and provision the VMs at the same time:
```sh
vagrant up --provision
```

You can specify different hostnames:
```sh
vagrant up proxy1 proxy2 web1 web2 --provision
```

If any config change is made you can provision the VMs again:
```sh
vagrant provision
```

You can specify different hostnames:
```sh
vagrant provision proxy1 proxy2 web1 web2
```

If you are not using Vagrant and VirtualBox, to provision and configure all specified hosts run de command:
```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

All existing tags, if any, can be listed by using:
```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --list-tags
```

If any password-protected encrypted vault file is needed for the execution of any playbook, you can add that password in a password file and refere to it while executing de ansible-playbook command by using:
```sh
ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=[vault_password_file] main.yml
```

If you don't want to be prompted for accepting the SSH fingerprint the first time you access one of the specified hosts, you can run:
```sh
ansible-playbook --ssh-common-args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no' --vault-password-file=[vault_password_file] main.yml
```

While executing ansible-playbook you can refere to its specific groups of hosts and roles. For example:
```sh
ansible-playbook main.yml --limit proxy
ansible-playbook main.yml --limit web
```

To encrypt this file execute the command:
```sh
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file=[vault_password_file] [filepath]
```
To decrypt this file execute the command:
```sh
ansible-vault decrypt --vault-password-file=[vault_password_file] [filepath]
```

To view this file execute the command without decrypting it:
```sh
ansible-vault view --vault-password-file=[vault_password_file] [filepath]
```

To edit this file execute the command without decrypting it:
```sh
ansible-vault edit --vault-password-file=[vault_password_file] [filepath]
```

Introduce de same password you store in the [vault_password_file] file.

**Never push to a git repository the secrets file unencrypted.**

## Test

Let's check if the machines provisioned do what they are suposed to.

### Proxy servers

There are two proxy servers configured in master-backup mode.
Proxy1 server is configured as master node and it has a global IP address configured (192.168.60.10) provided by its keepalived service.

You can check that with Ansible by using:

```sh
ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_all_ipv4_addresses' --limit proxy1
ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_all_ipv4_addresses' --limit proxy2
```
You can also check that with Vagrant by using:

```sh
vagrant ssh proxy1 -c 'sudo ip addr show eth1'
vagrant ssh proxy2 -c 'sudo ip addr show eth1'
```

You can stop haproxy service in proxy1 and see how proxy1 promotes as master.

Open a terminal window and execute:
```sh
vagrant ssh proxy1 -c 'sudo tail -f /var/log/messages'
```

Open a second terminal window and execute:
```sh
vagrant ssh proxy2 -c 'sudo tail -f /var/log/messages'
```

Open a third terminal window and execute:
```sh
vagrant ssh proxy1 -c 'sudo systemctl stop haproxy'
```

You will see proxy1 "Entering BACKUP STATE" and proxy2 "Entering MASTER STATE".
You can check again the IP addresses.

If you execute on the third terminal:
```sh
vagrant ssh proxy1 -c 'sudo systemctl start haproxy'
```

You will see proxy1 "Entering MASTER STATE" and proxy2 "Entering BACKUP STATE".
You can check again the IP addresses again.

### Web servers

The proxy servers load balance HTTP requests (roundrobin method) between two web servers: web1 and web2.
You can check it out by accessing the global IP address with the curl command:
```sh
curl http://192.168.60.10
```

Through proxy1 (master):
```sh
curl http://192.168.60.11
```

Or through proxy2 (backup):
```sh
curl http://192.168.60.12
```

You will see it balances requests between the two webservers.

The Ansible playbook also creates a self-signed SSL certificate for the domain name 'test@localhost'.
You can also perform an HTTPS request with this command:
```sh
curl -k https://test.localhost --resolve 'test.localhost:443:192.168.60.10'
```

You can access directly to web1:
```sh
curl http://192.168.60.21
```

You can access directly to web2:
```sh
curl http://192.168.60.22
```

You will see no balancing if you access the webservers directly.

Nginx status page has been enabled in each web server.
You can check Nginx status in a terminal window, while making HTTP request from another window or your web browser:
```sh
vagrant ssh web1 -c "sudo watch -n1 docker exec nginx curl http://localhost/nginx_status"
vagrant ssh web2 -c "sudo watch -n1 docker exec nginx curl http://localhost/nginx_status"
```
